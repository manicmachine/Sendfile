Before sending the file over, each side must know the encryption/decryption key. These are prompted
and entered before sending the file over (see session dialog above). The entire file is broken up into
packets based on the packet size specified in the command line, i.e., each packet cannot be over that size.
A large file will obviously require the sender to send a large number of packets each time.
